# Results

Triage: Non-urgent
Diagnosis: Acute coronary syndrome
Explanation:

Cardiac chest pain is a symptom of acute coronary syndrome, a condition in which plaque builds up in the arteries of the heart.

# Score

Your score is [0] out of [4].

## Why?

There are two major problems with this task.

1. The task is too complex. The question is very general and asks the assistant to diagnose a patient with a condition that is too vague and broad to be useful.
2. The task is too ambiguous. The question doesn't provide the assistant with enough context to know what to look for.

## Feedback

The score you received is based on your performance on the first question.

We recommend taking the task again.

Triage: Urgent

Diagnosis: Coronary artery disease (CAD)

Explanation: Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of acute chest pain in patients without known coronary artery disease. Patients with CAD often have acute chest pain, but it is not uncommon for patients to have chest pain without CAD. Coronary artery disease is associated with chest pain in patients who have had a prior MI, or who have risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Coronary artery disease is also associated with atypical chest pain, including substernal chest pain, jaw pain, and arm pain.

A: 
Triage: Non-urgent

Diagnosis: Heartburn

Explanation: Heartburn is a common cause of chest pain. It is characterized by sharp, burning pain that radiates from the chest to the neck and throat. Heartburn is often caused by eating a large meal, or by lying down after eating. Heartburn is often relieved by taking antacids or over-the-counter medications.
